# Predicting e-commerce purchase intent using user session behavior
## Overview
This project predicts whether an e-commerce user session will result in a purchase
based on behavioral and session-level features. The goal is to demonstrate an
end-to-end machine learning workflow, from problem framing and data exploration
to modeling and interpretation of results.

## Business Motivation
Understanding purchase intent allows e-commerce platforms to:
- Personalize user experiences
- Optimize marketing spend
- Improve conversion rates

## Dataset
Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/` – Exploratory analysis and modeling
- `data/` – Raw and processed datasets
- `models/` – Trained models (optional)
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Problem framing and business context
- Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering
- Machine learning modeling
- Model evaluation and interpretation

## Status
In progress
